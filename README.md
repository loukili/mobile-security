Introduction
===============
A plug n play appliance to secure server side REST Apis for Mobile apps access.

The goal of this project is to offer an easy way to handle mobile apps authentication, access/secret keys management, traking, managing rate limits, etc from server side apis and applications.

When creating mobile apps, the first thing to think about is how your api will be consumed? 
- By only your mobile app? 
- Do you want to open your api for a community to develop applications aroud it?
- Is it free? or your business model is build on it?
