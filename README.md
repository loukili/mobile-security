Introduction
===============
A plug n play appliance to secure server side REST/SOAP Apis for Mobile apps access.

The goal of this project is to offer an easy way to handle mobile apps authentication, access/secret keys management, traking, etc from server side apis and applications.

When creating mobile apps, the first thing to think about is how your api will be consumed? 
- By only your mobile app? 
- Do you want to open your api for a community to develop applications aroud it?
- Is it free? or your business model is build on it?
